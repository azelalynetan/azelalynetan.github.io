I joined the Accenture Develop Her: An All-Female Innovation Challenge last September 29 - 30, 2018 at Accenture Liquid Studio - Uptown together with my teammates, Ji-anne, Clara, Milky and Gracey. 

It was an amazing experience to collaborate and build solutions together in a supportive environment.

*Accenture Develop Her: An All-Female Innovation Challenge is an annual hackathon that aims to encourage female developers, designers and beginners â€” both graduating college students and professionalsâ€”to use their skills and capabilities to develop technology solutions to a stated problem statement.*
