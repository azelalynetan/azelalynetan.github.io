In 2023, I co-organized our first in-person event for Women Who Code Manila after the pandemic. It was a wonderful collaboration with ManilaCSS and PWDO, and such a joy to finally meet everyone face-to-face again after three years! ðŸ˜ƒ

*Women Who Code in the Dark is a frontend competition where contestants bring website designs to life using only a screenshot. Basic HTML, CSS, and a glow stick are all you need.*
