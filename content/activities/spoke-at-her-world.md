It was such an honor to be part of [("Her World");](https://www.facebook.com/print.herworld) in celebration of women in tech. I spoke about the power of presence and why we should never underestimate the positive impact we can have on others. ðŸ’œ My hope is that I was able to empower fellow Women in Tech to keep aspiring and to inspire others along their way.
