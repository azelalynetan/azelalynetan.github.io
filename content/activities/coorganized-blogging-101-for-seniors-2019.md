As one of the leader of Women Who Code, I helped initiate and collaborate with Techie Seniors and Retirees Philippines to co-organize a special Grandparentsâ€™ Day event for our elderly lolos and lolas (seniors). 

This was one of the most memorable events Iâ€™ve been part ofâ€”we guided them through internet security, blogging, using Canva, and even creating their very first email accounts. 

I also gave a short talk on Blogging 101, showing them how to easily create their own blogs using WordPress. It was such a rewarding experience to teach our elderly about technology and see their excitement as they learned new skills.
