In 2019, I had the opportunity to volunteer at Women Who Code Connect Asia at Lifelong Learning Institute in Singapore, where I collaborated with fellow Women Who Code Network leaders to bring this event to life in Asia. It was such a meaningful experience to contribute behind the scenesâ€”working with an inspiring group of women leaders, supporting the event flow, and helping create a space where technologists could learn, connect, and grow.

Being part of Connect Asia 2019 reminded me of the power of community and collaboration. It wasnâ€™t just about organizing logisticsâ€”it was about enabling conversations, amplifying diverse voices in tech, and fostering connections that go beyond the event itself.

CONNECT is Women Who Code's premier developer conference designed to help engineers level up in their career.
