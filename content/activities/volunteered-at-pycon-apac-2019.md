It was such an amazing experience to help organize Python APAC as part of the logistics team. Volunteering taught me so much and gave me the chance to see how passionate the Python community is. Itâ€™s always fun to give back, meet new people, and even make new friends along the way. Thank you, PythonPH â€” and letâ€™s continue improving ourselves and learning together!
