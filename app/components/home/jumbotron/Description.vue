        I&apos;m a frontend developer based in the Philippines ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­, 
        passionate about creating modern and accessible websites. 
        I mainly work with Nuxt and Tailwind to build smooth, user-friendly experiences. 
        I&apos;m always learningâ€”Next.js is next on my list 
        and I also have some experience working with backend tools 
        like APIs and Supabase to better understand how everything connects.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-2">
        Beyond coding, I believe the small details matter â€” from smooth interactions to layouts that just feel right. Iâ€™ve also been an active volunteer in tech communities, where I loved sharing knowledge and connecting with fellow developers.
