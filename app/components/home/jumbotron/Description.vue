        Iâ€™m a frontend developer based on the Philippines ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­ with a focus on building modern, accessible, and performant websites. 
        I enjoy working with Vue, Nuxt, and Tailwind to bring designs to life and create experiences that feel intuitive.

      <p class="mb-2">
        Beyond coding, I believe the small details matter â€” from smooth interactions to layouts that just feel right. Iâ€™ve also been an active volunteer in tech communities, where I loved sharing knowledge and connecting with fellow developers.
